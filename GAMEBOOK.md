## 🌟 The Legend Begins

Once upon a time, in a digital dimension far, far away, there existed a mystical 4×4 grid. Legend has it that whoever combines tiles to reach the sacred number **2048** will unlock ultimate gaming glory. But beware! The grid is unforgiving, and only those with strategy, patience, and a touch of luck will succeed.

**Your Mission:** Slide, merge, and conquer. Reach 2048... or die trying. (Okay, not literally die, but you know what we mean.)

---

## 🎯 How to Play (For Mere Mortals)

### Basic Controls
- **Arrow Keys** ↑ ↓ ← → - Slide tiles in any direction
- **Swipe** (on touch devices) - For the cool kids on mobile
- **Pray to RNGesus** - Sometimes a 4 appears instead of a 2 🙏

### The Sacred Rules
1. **Slide All Tiles**: When you move, ALL tiles slide in that direction
2. **Merge Twins**: When two tiles with the same number touch, they become ONE MEGA TILE
3. **Score Points**: Each merge adds to your score (bigger merges = bigger points)
4. **Don't Get Stuck**: If the grid fills up and you can't move... GAME OVER! 💀
5. **Keep Going**: After 2048, the game doesn't end - go for 4096, 8192, 16384, and beyond!

### Grid Sizes
- **4×4** - Classic mode for purists and masochists
- **5×5** - More space, more chaos, more fun! (Click the 5×5 button to unlock)

## 🧠 Pro Tips & Strategies

### The Corner Strategy
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐
**Description**: Keep your highest tile in one corner (bottom-right recommended)
1. Choose a corner and NEVER move away from it
2. Build tiles in descending order from that corner
3. Use only 3 directions, avoid the 4th direction that moves away from corner
4. Creates a "snake" pattern of descending values

### The Edge Method
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Description**: Build high-value tiles along one edge
1. Keep highest tiles along bottom row
2. Next highest in second row
3. Allows more flexibility than corner strategy
4. Requires careful planning

### The Merge Chain
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Description**: Set up cascading merges
1. Align multiple pairs in a row/column
2. One move triggers chain reaction
3. Massively satisfying
4. High risk, high reward

### The Checkerboard (DON'T DO THIS)
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (to recover from)
**Description**: Accidentally creating alternating high/low tiles
1. This is BAD. Very bad.
2. If this happens, use Shuffle powerup
3. Or start over
4. Learn from your mistakes

### Powerup Optimization
- **Save Undo**: For critical mistakes only
- **Use Swap**: Freely to maintain strategy
- **Lock Strategically**: When setting up big merges
- **Shuffle Last Resort**: Only when truly stuck
- **Remove Wisely**: Only small blocking tiles
- **Double at Peak**: On your highest tile for max value
